## ***User Experience Design (UXD)***

### *Wire Frame*
I utilised Balsamiq to produce wireframes of how the game would appear across different devices. 
Although the game is intended to be contained within one page, I produced wireframes for the different content that would appear on the page. 
Using Balsamiq helped me to consider many different layouts for the game elements before choosing the final design.
